# Heroku Buildpack: Node Cleanup

Make the official Heroku buildpack for Node.js compatible with other buildpacks

### Delete the node_modules directory

The maximum allowed Heroku slug size (after compression) is 300MB. Image-heavy apps can somethings butt up against this limit, especially when using multiple buildpacks. If you're using Node.js to compile your front-end assets, but not to run your app, you may be able to save a large amount of space by deleting the `node_modules` directory before slug compilation.

### Support running an app from a subdirectory

Set the `NPM_PREFIX` environment variable to the relative path of the subdirectory that contains the `node_modules` directory that you'd like to delete.

### Delete the nodejs.sh startup script

There is currently an incompatibility between the Node.js and other buildpacks.  On dyno boot, the `nodejs.sh` startup script sets the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` variable. The launch scripts of subsequent buildpacks will pick this us with no way of knowing that it wasn't set by a user.

## Usage

First, set the Node.js buildpack to compile your assets:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
```

Next, add the Node Cleanup buildpack to get rid of the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set --index 1 https://github.com/josephabrahams/heroku-buildpack-node-cleanup
```

Finally, add whichever buildpack runs your app:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set --index 2 heroku/python
```
